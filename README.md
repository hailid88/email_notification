Alert System
==================

An alert system written using Python to generate informative reports on the status of the sensors, which signicantly reduced the maintenance cost.

The system is mainly used to collect the information provided by Nagios and then reformat the information into HTML tables to send to system managers for maintenance. An example of email sent by the system is shown at https://github.com/hailid88/email_notification/wiki
